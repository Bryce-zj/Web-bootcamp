        The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild
        species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or
        cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been
        castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
        Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
        Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. The chicken
        domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers.

        There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and
        literature.[citation needed]
